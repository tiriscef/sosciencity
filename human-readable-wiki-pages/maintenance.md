#Maintenance

In Sosciencity you need mechanics that maintain your machines. That's the job of the Clockwork caste. If your city doesn't have enough maintenance work done, your factory will begin to slow down. To support your factory, you need a proportionally sized city.

- Each active machine needs 1 Clockwork Point to function properly. Active means that it worked during the last 2 minutes.

- When you don't have enough maintenance work for the size of your factory, your machines can slow down by up to -60%. 

- In the beginning of the game this can be tough. So don't build big until you have a healthy settlement going.

- On the other hand: Surplus points will even increase the speed of your machines. That's the normal Clockwork bonus.

*There are free 'startup' points, configurable in the Map settings. You might want to adjust these if you're playing Sosciencity together with a complex mod. (Alternatively you can disable this mechanic entirely in the settings - in case you don't like it.)*
