#Composting

Hey. I'm rosiscef from the Orchid Caste. You can call me Rose.

Tiri said you need some explanation about composting. Yee. You look like an urbanite. That's okay.

Where do I start. You know plants, right? Like trees, or flowers. You see. They grow out of the ground. Because they have roots in there. The roots are not only for stability. They also get water and nutrients. If you want your plants to really thrive and grow big, you need good, nutrient-rich soil. So.. how do you get that?

The answer ist Composting! You take plant parts you don't need, like [item=leafage]. And you just pile them up. There are bacteria in the ground which will eat the stuff and turn it into [item=humus] - that's a smart word for 'soil with a lot of nutrients'. It's kind of a cycle. Soil turns into plant, plant turns back into soil.

First, you build a [item=composting-silo]. Those Clockwork guys engineered that to provide a good environment for your ground bacteria. You throw it aaaalll in there. And on the bottom of your huge plant-pile, the bacteria party starts.

But now the [item=humus] is there right at the bottom. A bit inconvenient. For that they designed a [item=composting-silo-output]. You need to place it anywhere near your silo and it will get you the humus with some underground machinery or something like that. I don't know how that works, haha. Just glad it does!

We have a catalogue with all the items that can be composted somewhere in the dayda-tab. It's also mentioned in the tooltips.

Yee. Did I forget something? Some sugar-rich plants create mold inside your silo while they get composted. That's okay. Don't panic. You don't have to clean it up. It won't clog up the silo. And I heard even mold can be useful sometimes.
