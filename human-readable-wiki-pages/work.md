#Huwan Productivity

There are 2 ways in which huwans can be useful for you and your factory: they can either work at a nearby located building that needs workers - or they can work on their own authority and provide a caste bonus that buffs some aspects of you whole city or factory. 


##Factory Work

Some buildings need a workforce to function properly, like for example the [item=ember-hq]. The tooltip of these manufactories tell you how many workers of which castes are required. You need to place these near the homes of potential workers, because huwans don't like to commute long distances. The highlighted range when placing a building with workforce shows you which houses are close enough to work there. Manufactories employ their required amount of huwans automatically. You can limit how many they should employ in their GUI.

The performance of manufactories depends on how many workers are working there and how happy they are.

Working in a factory has some risks for your huwans. From time to time they get sick from **Workplace Injuries**. Only healthy huwans are able to work in a factory. If they are sick they'll do the only sane thing which is staying home and focusing on their recovery. 


##Caste Bonus Work

Huwans that are not working in a manufactory will still try to be useful for your city. Instead they are working to provide a caste specific bonus for your city. This work gets video game-like quantified as 'caste points'. The more caste points all of your huwans of one caste generate, the bigger the caste bonus. You can see the current caste bonuses on the top left of your screen.

Even huwans that are sick provide caste points - although at a reduced rate, depending on disease.
