#Blood Donations

Sometimes you just need some blood. Maybe to treat some sick huwan, maybe for some biotechnological process, maybe not, I don't judge. 

In the beginning you can donate blood by yourself at the cost of some health points. But you are limited by your body's ability to recover. You might only want to donate once - maybe twice, per day (around 7 real world minutes) or else it will hurt much more.

But as a seasoned Factorio player, you surely want to avoid having to do this manually all the time. The key to automation is the [technology=transfusion-medicine] research. This allows your huwans to donate blood in a nearby hospital or med bay. 

Only healthy huwans will donate blood. How often they do this depends on their Health. The blood donation needs **10 operations** on the side of the hospital.
