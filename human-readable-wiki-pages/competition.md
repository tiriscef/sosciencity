#Competition for Resources

In Sosciencity there are some buildings that use natural resources, like the [item=groundwater-pump] which uses ground water, the [item=hunting-hut] which needs nearby forests or the [item=fishing-hut] which needs nearby water bodies. 

There is a phenomenon I like to call 'Competition for Resources'. That means: if there are multiple of these buildings present in an area, they begin to overuse the natural resources present. They hinder each other and lower each others performance. You still get more productivity in total. But the individual building will work slower with each one sharing the area.
