#Huwans 101

Huwans are really fragile and needy at times. You're taking on a lot of responsibility by trying and building a whole city full of them. This article aims to give you an overview of all the things you need to know about how to keep huwans alive and happy. 


##Happiness, Health, Sanity

These are your main metrics that give you a clue about how your huwans are feeling. In Alt-Mode you can get a quick glance on their values when you hover your mouse over a home. When you open a house, you can see a breakdown of all the factors at play in the 'Details' Tab. 

These metrics are inert. Meaning if a influence on them changes, it takes a small while until the actual values reach the new predicted values. 

Generally: The higher these metrics are, the better. Values over 10 are generally good; values below 10 get increasingly critical. 


###Happiness

- Happiness is kind of your most important metric as it's tied with the productivity of your inhabitants. The happier your huwans are, the more caste points they provide and the more they get done when working at a building.

- If the happiness drops below a caste-specific threshold (5 for most of the early game castes), the inhabitants get fed up with your city and begin to leave. 


###Health

- Health directly influences how often your inhabitants get sick from general diseases like the flu.

- The biggest influence on your inhabitants health is the food and water they're provided.

- Health also has a influence on happiness. Health values over 10 translate to a happiness bonus; values below 10 translate to a drastic multiplicative malus.


###Sanity

- Sanity directly influences how often your inhabitants get sick from mental health issues like burnout.

- The biggest influence on your inhabitants is the quality of their home and how many people they interact with on a daily basis. 

- Sanity also has a influence on happiness. Sanity values over 10 translate to a happiness bonus; values below 10 translate to a drastic multiplicative malus.

Let's take a look on all the things you need to provide to your city.


##Homes

Everyone needs some kind of home with a roof on top. Homeless huwans won't be able to live comfortably and work for you. How well you accommodated your inhabitants 

The houses you can build differ in 3 attributes:

- **Room Count:** Simply how big the building is. This determines how many huwans can live inside. Most early game castes need one room per inhabitant, but the later ones are more demanding.
- **Comfort:** Describes how well equipped and furnished the house is. This directly influences the inhabitant's happiness and sanity. The castes later in the game are again more demanding and won't move into a house that's not comfortable enough for them.
- **Qualities:** Describes how the house looks and feels from inside. Every caste has their own ideas which qualities they like or despise. For example: people from the Clockwork Caste like houses with the 'technical' quality, but are less happy with a 'decorated' home.

If you don't have enough housing space for the amount of huwans, the remaining ones will become homeless.


###Homelessness

Once huwans are homeless they evade the statistical surveys of your city. So you can't know exactly how many there are and how they are doing. 

Homeless huwans won't be able to work for you. Neither in factories nor for the caste bonus.

Instead your homeless citizens will try to find a new home. They will move into houses with free spaces if there are new ones. They even might seize houses that are built but not assigned to a specific caste. If that fails, they even try to build their own shacks near Market Halls. 

Being homeless is a tough fortune. Over time these huwans will leave your city and try to find a better life somewhere else.


##Food

Your inhabitants need something to eat. You can provide them food either by placing it inside their home or in a nearby [item=market-hall]. What your inhabitants get to eat has several effects on their happiness, health and sanity. 

- **Castes:** Every caste has a taste that they like and one that they dislike. Food that matches that will make them happier.
- **Happiness:** The Taste quality and Luxury of the foods provided affect Happiness. How important both categories are depends on the Caste.
- **Variety:** Providing many different kinds of food makes people has a positive effect on Happiness.
- **Healthiness:** You are what you eat, so the Healthiness values of the provided foods affect the Health of your people.
- **Nutrients:** The macronutrients of the foods also affect Health. An optimal diet consists of 20% protein, 50% carbohydrates and 30% fat. The closer the food mix comes to that, the better.
- **Sanity:** Usually there is no effect on Sanity. But if you provide e.g. just neutral-tasting food or just food whose taste the caste hates - that will mess with your inhabitant's psyche.

Better make sure that your food supply is steady and sufficient, as having nothing to eat will make your inhabitants freak out quickly.

*Note from the mod author: I'm unsatisfied with the current, overcomplicated state of the food system. A rework of these mechanics is planned.*


##Water

Your inhabitants need drinkable water. You can provide that with a [item=water-tower] placed in range of their house. Better make sure that your water supply is steady and sufficient, as having nothing to drink will make your inhabitants freak out quickly.

The normal water you get with a offshore pump is really unsafe to drink. You'll need to get clean groundwater with a [item=groundwater-pump] in the beginning. One such pump can provide water for around 120 huwans. Later on you can unlock more options to get drinkable water.

If a house has access to multiple water towers with different kinds of drinking water, the huwans will consume water from the tower with the highest quality water first.

*Unfortunately you cannot mix different water qualities. That's a hard limitation of Factorio's engine. Instead you'll need to place pipings and water towers for every kind of drinking water that you want to supply.*


##Garbage Collection

Your huwans produce [item=garbage] and [item=food-leftovers] over time. Providing a [item=trash-site] nearby will make your inhabitants dispose garbage there. Without garbage collection, the garbage will end up in the homes of your huwans. This will make them unhappy and can even take a toll on their health.

Getting rid of garbage isn't easy. In the beginning there aren't many more options than stuffing it into a [item=waste-dump] and forgetting about it. Over time you will unlock better methods to get rid of the trash.


##Healthcare

Everyone get sick from time to time. If huwans are sick, they won't work for the nearby factories. However, they will still work and provide points for the caste bonus with a diminished productivity. Diseases are very versatile and come from multiple sources:

- **General Diseases:** Huwans get these from time to time, depending on their Health.
- **Mental Health Issues:** Sometimes people develop mental health problems. Life is not easy. A high Sanity value decreases the frequency of those.
- **Workplace Injuries:** Working in a factory takes a toll on your inhabitants. Exhaustion and workplace accidents sometimes knocks them out.
- **Birth Defects:** Some inhabitants come to this world with disabilities. These are usually hard to treat and don't cure naturally.
- **Escalations:** Some diseases can escalate into a different, more serious illness if not treated by a medical professional.
- **Complications:** Not every treatment works every time. Some can have side effects and give your huwans another disease instead.

Some of these diseases go away naturally after some time. But others don't. Some are even infectious and can spread in your city if left unchecked. So it is advisable to provide healthcare to your inhabitants to keep everyone save, healthy and productive.

You can provide healthcare to your people by building med bays or hospitals. These cure all sick huwans living in range - if possible. By opening a hospital you can get an overview of all the untreated diseases in their range.

Curing a disease takes some work by the healthcare workers (displayed as 'operations') and might need some medicine items that you can provide either inside the hospital building or in a pharmacy. Some diseases even require extra hospital facilities, which need to be placed next to the main hospital building.
