#Welcome to Sosciencity


To progress in Sosciencity you'll need to built a city with happy huwans living in there. The huwan society is split into 8 castes, all with their own lifestyle and needs. While you progress throughout the mod, you will integrate them all into your city one after another.

In Sosciencity you'll need your huwans to help with your research. You might already have noticed that you need [item=sketchbook] to produce the first science pack. You can [recipe=brainstorm] a bit and come up with your own for now, but to automate them you'll need to unlock the [tech=ember-caste].


##Your First Settlement

But before you're able to welcome your first huwans, you need to prepare some infrastructure to meet the basic needs of your people.

- **Housing:** Everyone needs some kind of home with a roof on top. Homeless inhabitants won't be able to live comfortably and work for you. So built some houses first. In the beginning you are limited to [item=living-container]. Those are nothing much, but will work just fine for the first 3 castes. After building a house, click on it and assign it to a caste to allow them to move inside.
- **Food:** Collect some food via [Gather Food], so your inhabitants have something to eat. You can provide food by either placing it in their homes or in a nearby [item=market-hall].
- **Water:** Provide water to your people's homes with a [item=water-tower] in range of your houses. The normal water you use to power your steam-engines isn't exactly save to consume. So better drill for some [fluid=drinkable-water] with a [item=groundwater-pump].
- **Garbage:** Soon your inhabitants will produce some garbage. If you don't provide them a way to get rid of it, trash will accumulate in their homes and make everyone sick. Better build a [item=trash-site] nearby, so they have a place to dispose it. Getting rid of all that trash is a bit tricky at first. So built a [item=waste-dump] to store it for now. Future you will have this covered.
Tip: Place your first settlement next to a forest or a body of water. This way you can automate the food supply with a [item=hunting-hut] or [item=fishing-hut].


##But where do huwans come from?

Huwans come from eggs, duh. Once you have your basic infrastructure in place, build an [item=upbringing-station]. This building will hatch and raise any huwan eggs you put inside.

Upon graduation the small huwans will join a caste and move into a home with free space. You can influence their upbringing to increase the chance that they join the caste you want - but in the end it's their life and they might join another instead.

You can get your first eggs at the cost of some food calories via [recipe=lay-egg].

*The reproductive biology of huwans is more complex than that of humans. You, the engineer, are some kind of queen gender that can reproduce asexually. But your children will be agender and infertile. Later on you might find a way to get gendered huwans that can reproduce and lay eggs without your involvement. (Don't quote me too hard on all that, I'm not a biologist.)*
