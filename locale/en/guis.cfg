introduction=Introduction
introduction-text1=Welcome to Sosciencity
introduction-text2=To progress in Sosciencity you'll need to built a city with happy huwans living in there. The huwan society is split into 8 castes, all with their own lifestyle and needs. While you progress throughout the mod, you will integrate them all into your city one after another.
introduction-text3=In Sosciencity you'll need your huwans to help with your research. You might already have noticed that you need [font=default-bold][color=#80CC33][item=sketchbook]__ITEM__sketchbook__[/color][/font] to produce the first science pack. You can [font=default-bold][color=#80CC33][recipe=brainstorm]brainstorm[/color][/font] a bit and come up with your own for now, but to automate them you'll need to unlock the [font=default-bold][color=#80CC33][technology=ember-caste]Ember HQ[/color][/font].
introduction-text4=Your First Settlement
introduction-text5=But before you're able to welcome your first huwans, you need to prepare some infrastructure to meet the basic needs of your people.
introduction-text6=[font=default-bold]Housing:[/font] Everyone needs some kind of home with a roof on top. Homeless inhabitants won't be able to live comfortably and work for you. So built some houses first. In the beginning you are limited to [font=default-bold][color=#80CC33][item=living-container]__ITEM__living-container__[/color][/font]. Those are nothing much, but will work just fine for the first 3 castes. After building a house, click on it and assign it to a caste to allow them to move inside.
introduction-text7=[font=default-bold]Food:[/font] Collect some food via [Gather Food], so your inhabitants have something to eat. You can provide food by either placing it in their homes or in a nearby [font=default-bold][color=#80CC33][item=market-hall]__ITEM__market-hall__[/color][/font].
introduction-text8=[font=default-bold]Water:[/font] Provide water to your people's homes with a [font=default-bold][color=#80CC33][item=water-tower]__ITEM__water-tower__[/color][/font] in range of your houses. The normal water you use to power your steam-engines isn't exactly save to consume. So better drill for some [font=default-bold][color=#80CC33][fluid=drinkable-water]__FLUID__drinkable-water__[/color][/font] with a [font=default-bold][color=#80CC33][item=groundwater-pump]__ITEM__groundwater-pump__[/color][/font].
introduction-text9=[font=default-bold]Garbage:[/font] Soon your inhabitants will produce some garbage. If you don't provide them a way to get rid of it, trash will accumulate in their homes and make everyone sick. Better build a [font=default-bold][color=#80CC33][item=trash-site]__ITEM__trash-site__[/color][/font] nearby, so they have a place to dispose it. Getting rid of all that trash is a bit tricky at first. So built a [font=default-bold][color=#80CC33][item=waste-dump]__ITEM__waste-dump__[/color][/font] to store it for now. Future you will have this covered.
introduction-text10=Tip: Place your first settlement next to a forest or a body of water. This way you can automate the food supply with a [font=default-bold][color=#80CC33][item=hunting-hut]__ITEM__hunting-hut__[/color][/font] or [font=default-bold][color=#80CC33][item=fishing-hut]__ITEM__fishing-hut__[/color][/font].
introduction-text11=But where do huwans come from?
introduction-text12=Huwans come from eggs, duh. Once you have your basic infrastructure in place, build an [font=default-bold][color=#80CC33][item=upbringing-station]__ITEM__upbringing-station__[/color][/font]. This building will hatch and raise any huwan eggs you put inside.
introduction-text13=Upon graduation the small huwans will join a caste and move into a home with free space. You can influence their upbringing to increase the chance that they join the caste you want - but in the end it's their life and they might join another instead.
introduction-text14=You can get your first eggs at the cost of some food calories via [font=default-bold][color=#80CC33][recipe=lay-egg]Asexual Reproduction[/color][/font].
introduction-text15=[color=#CCCCCC]The reproductive biology of huwans is more complex than that of humans. You, the engineer, are some kind of queen gender that can reproduce asexually. But your children will be agender and infertile. Later on you might find a way to get gendered huwans that can reproduce and lay eggs without your involvement. (Don't quote me too hard on all that, I'm not a biologist.)[/color]

huwans101-text1=Huwans 101
huwans101-text2=Huwans are really fragile and needy at times. You're taking on a lot of responsibility by trying and building a whole city full of them. This article aims to give you an overview of all the things you need to know about how to keep huwans alive and happy.
huwans101-text3=Happiness, Health, Sanity
huwans101-text4=These are your main metrics that give you a clue about how your huwans are feeling. In Alt-Mode you can get a quick glance on their values when you hover your mouse over a home. When you open a house, you can see a breakdown of all the factors at play in the 'Details' Tab.
huwans101-text5=These metrics are inert. Meaning if a influence on them changes, it takes a small while until the actual values reach the new predicted values.
huwans101-text6=Generally: The higher these metrics are, the better. Values over 10 are generally good; values below 10 get increasingly critical.
huwans101-text7=Happiness
huwans101-text8=Happiness is kind of your most important metric as it's tied with the productivity of your inhabitants. The happier your huwans are, the more caste points they provide and the more they get done when working at a building.
huwans101-text9=If the happiness drops below a caste-specific threshold (5 for most of the early game castes), the inhabitants get fed up with your city and begin to leave.
huwans101-text10=Health
huwans101-text11=Health directly influences how often your inhabitants get sick from general diseases like the flu.
huwans101-text12=The biggest influence on your inhabitants health is the food and water they're provided.
huwans101-text13=Health also has a influence on happiness. Health values over 10 translate to a happiness bonus; values below 10 translate to a drastic multiplicative malus.
huwans101-text14=Sanity
huwans101-text15=Sanity directly influences how often your inhabitants get sick from mental health issues like burnout.
huwans101-text16=The biggest influence on your inhabitants is the quality of their home and how many people they interact with on a daily basis.
huwans101-text17=Sanity also has a influence on happiness. Sanity values over 10 translate to a happiness bonus; values below 10 translate to a drastic multiplicative malus.
huwans101-text18=Let's take a look on all the things you need to provide to your city.
huwans101-text19=Homes
huwans101-text20=Everyone needs some kind of home with a roof on top. Homeless huwans won't be able to live comfortably and work for you. How well you accommodated your inhabitants
huwans101-text21=The houses you can build differ in 3 attributes:
huwans101-text22=[font=default-bold]Room Count:[/font] Simply how big the building is. This determines how many huwans can live inside. Most early game castes need one room per inhabitant, but the later ones are more demanding.
huwans101-text23=[font=default-bold]Comfort:[/font] Describes how well equipped and furnished the house is. This directly influences the inhabitant's happiness and sanity. The castes later in the game are again more demanding and won't move into a house that's not comfortable enough for them.
huwans101-text24=[font=default-bold]Qualities:[/font] Describes how the house looks and feels from inside. Every caste has their own ideas which qualities they like or despise. For example: people from the Clockwork Caste like houses with the 'technical' quality, but are less happy with a 'decorated' home.
huwans101-text25=If you don't have enough housing space for the amount of huwans, the remaining ones will become homeless.
huwans101-text26=Homelessness
huwans101-text27=Once huwans are homeless they evade the statistical surveys of your city. So you can't know exactly how many there are and how they are doing.
huwans101-text28=Homeless huwans won't be able to work for you. Neither in factories nor for the caste bonus.
huwans101-text29=Instead your homeless citizens will try to find a new home. They will move into houses with free spaces if there are new ones. They even might seize houses that are built but not assigned to a specific caste. If that fails, they even try to build their own shacks near Market Halls.
huwans101-text30=Being homeless is a tough fortune. Over time these huwans will leave your city and try to find a better life somewhere else.
huwans101-text31=Food
huwans101-text32=Your inhabitants need something to eat. You can provide them food either by placing it inside their home or in a nearby [font=default-bold][color=#80CC33][item=market-hall]__ITEM__market-hall__[/color][/font]. What your inhabitants get to eat has several effects on their happiness, health and sanity.
huwans101-text33=[font=default-bold]Castes:[/font] Every caste has a taste that they like and one that they dislike. Food that matches that will make them happier.
huwans101-text34=[font=default-bold]Happiness:[/font] The Taste quality and Luxury of the foods provided affect Happiness. How important both categories are depends on the Caste.
huwans101-text35=[font=default-bold]Variety:[/font] Providing many different kinds of food makes people has a positive effect on Happiness.
huwans101-text36=[font=default-bold]Healthiness:[/font] You are what you eat, so the Healthiness values of the provided foods affect the Health of your people.
huwans101-text37=[font=default-bold]Nutrients:[/font] The macronutrients of the foods also affect Health. An optimal diet consists of 20% protein, 50% carbohydrates and 30% fat. The closer the food mix comes to that, the better.
huwans101-text38=[font=default-bold]Sanity:[/font] Usually there is no effect on Sanity. But if you provide e.g. just neutral-tasting food or just food whose taste the caste hates - that will mess with your inhabitant's psyche.
huwans101-text39=Better make sure that your food supply is steady and sufficient, as having nothing to eat will make your inhabitants freak out quickly.
huwans101-text40=[color=#CCCCCC]Note from the mod author: I'm unsatisfied with the current, overcomplicated state of the food system. A rework of these mechanics is planned.[/color]
huwans101-text41=Water
huwans101-text42=Your inhabitants need drinkable water. You can provide that with a [font=default-bold][color=#80CC33][item=water-tower]__ITEM__water-tower__[/color][/font] placed in range of their house. Better make sure that your water supply is steady and sufficient, as having nothing to drink will make your inhabitants freak out quickly.
huwans101-text43=The normal water you get with a offshore pump is really unsafe to drink. You'll need to get clean groundwater with a [font=default-bold][color=#80CC33][item=groundwater-pump]__ITEM__groundwater-pump__[/color][/font] in the beginning. One such pump can provide water for around 120 huwans. Later on you can unlock more options to get drinkable water.
huwans101-text44=If a house has access to multiple water towers with different kinds of drinking water, the huwans will consume water from the tower with the highest quality water first.
huwans101-text45=[color=#CCCCCC]Unfortunately you cannot mix different water qualities. That's a hard limitation of Factorio's engine. Instead you'll need to place pipings and water towers for every kind of drinking water that you want to supply.[/color]
huwans101-text46=Garbage Collection
huwans101-text47=Your huwans produce [font=default-bold][color=#80CC33][item=garbage]__ITEM__garbage__[/color][/font] and [font=default-bold][color=#80CC33][item=food-leftovers]__ITEM__food-leftovers__[/color][/font] over time. Providing a [font=default-bold][color=#80CC33][item=trash-site]__ITEM__trash-site__[/color][/font] nearby will make your inhabitants dispose garbage there. Without garbage collection, the garbage will end up in the homes of your huwans. This will make them unhappy and can even take a toll on their health.
huwans101-text48=Getting rid of garbage isn't easy. In the beginning there aren't many more options than stuffing it into a [font=default-bold][color=#80CC33][item=waste-dump]__ITEM__waste-dump__[/color][/font] and forgetting about it. Over time you will unlock better methods to get rid of the trash.
huwans101-text49=Healthcare
huwans101-text50=Everyone get sick from time to time. If huwans are sick, they won't work for the nearby factories. However, they will still work and provide points for the caste bonus with a diminished productivity. Diseases are very versatile and come from multiple sources:
huwans101-text51=[font=default-bold]General Diseases:[/font] Huwans get these from time to time, depending on their Health.
huwans101-text52=[font=default-bold]Mental Health Issues:[/font] Sometimes people develop mental health problems. Life is not easy. A high Sanity value decreases the frequency of those.
huwans101-text53=[font=default-bold]Workplace Injuries:[/font] Working in a factory takes a toll on your inhabitants. Exhaustion and workplace accidents sometimes knocks them out.
huwans101-text54=[font=default-bold]Birth Defects:[/font] Some inhabitants come to this world with disabilities. These are usually hard to treat and don't cure naturally.
huwans101-text55=[font=default-bold]Escalations:[/font] Some diseases can escalate into a different, more serious illness if not treated by a medical professional.
huwans101-text56=[font=default-bold]Complications:[/font] Not every treatment works every time. Some can have side effects and give your huwans another disease instead.
huwans101-text57=Some of these diseases go away naturally after some time. But others don't. Some are even infectious and can spread in your city if left unchecked. So it is advisable to provide healthcare to your inhabitants to keep everyone save, healthy and productive.
huwans101-text58=You can provide healthcare to your people by building med bays or hospitals. These cure all sick huwans living in range - if possible. By opening a hospital you can get an overview of all the untreated diseases in their range.
huwans101-text59=Curing a disease takes some work by the healthcare workers (displayed as 'operations') and might need some medicine items that you can provide either inside the hospital building or in a pharmacy. Some diseases even require extra hospital facilities, which need to be placed next to the main hospital building.

work=Work
work-text1=Huwan Productivity
work-text2=There are 2 ways in which huwans can be useful for you and your factory: they can either work at a nearby located building that needs workers - or they can work on their own authority and provide a caste bonus that buffs some aspects of you whole city or factory.
work-text3=Factory Work
work-text4=Some buildings need a workforce to function properly, like for example the [font=default-bold][color=#80CC33][item=ember-hq]__ITEM__ember-hq__[/color][/font]. The tooltip of these manufactories tell you how many workers of which castes are required. You need to place these near the homes of potential workers, because huwans don't like to commute long distances. The highlighted range when placing a building with workforce shows you which houses are close enough to work there. Manufactories employ their required amount of huwans automatically. You can limit how many they should employ in their GUI.
work-text5=The performance of manufactories depends on how many workers are working there and how happy they are.
work-text6=Working in a factory has some risks for your huwans. From time to time they get sick from [font=default-bold]Workplace Injuries[/font]. Only healthy huwans are able to work in a factory. If they are sick they'll do the only sane thing which is staying home and focusing on their recovery.
work-text7=Caste Bonus Work
work-text8=Huwans that are not working in a manufactory will still try to be useful for your city. Instead they are working to provide a caste specific bonus for your city. This work gets video game-like quantified as 'caste points'. The more caste points all of your huwans of one caste generate, the bigger the caste bonus. You can see the current caste bonuses on the top left of your screen.
work-text9=Even huwans that are sick provide caste points - although at a reduced rate, depending on disease.

maintenance-text1=Maintenance
maintenance-text2=In Sosciencity you need mechanics that maintain your machines. That's the job of the Clockwork caste. If your city doesn't have enough maintenance work done, your factory will begin to slow down. To support your factory, you need a proportionally sized city.
maintenance-text3=Each active machine needs 1 Clockwork Point to function properly. Active means that it worked during the last 2 minutes.
maintenance-text4=When you don't have enough maintenance work for the size of your factory, your machines can slow down by up to -60%.
maintenance-text5=In the beginning of the game this can be tough. So don't build big until you have a healthy settlement going.
maintenance-text6=On the other hand: Surplus points will even increase the speed of your machines. That's the normal Clockwork bonus.
maintenance-text7=[color=#CCCCCC]There are free 'startup' points, configurable in the Map settings. You might want to adjust these if you're playing Sosciencity together with a complex mod. (Alternatively you can disable this mechanic entirely in the settings - in case you don't like it.)[/color]

competition-text1=Competition for Resources
competition-text2=In Sosciencity there are some buildings that use natural resources, like the [font=default-bold][color=#80CC33][item=groundwater-pump]__ITEM__groundwater-pump__[/color][/font] which uses ground water, the [font=default-bold][color=#80CC33][item=hunting-hut]__ITEM__hunting-hut__[/color][/font] which needs nearby forests or the [font=default-bold][color=#80CC33][item=fishing-hut]__ITEM__fishing-hut__[/color][/font] which needs nearby water bodies.
competition-text3=There is a phenomenon I like to call 'Competition for Resources'. That means: if there are multiple of these buildings present in an area, they begin to overuse the natural resources present. They hinder each other and lower each others performance. You still get more productivity in total. But the individual building will work slower with each one sharing the area.

composting-text1=Composting
composting-text2=Hey. I'm rosiscef from the Orchid Caste. You can call me Rose.
composting-text3=Tiri said you need some explanation about composting. Yee. You look like an urbanite. That's okay.
composting-text4=Where do I start. You know plants, right? Like trees, or flowers. You see. They grow out of the ground. Because they have roots in there. The roots are not only for stability. They also get water and nutrients. If you want your plants to really thrive and grow big, you need good, nutrient-rich soil. So.. how do you get that?
composting-text5=The answer ist Composting! You take plant parts you don't need, like [font=default-bold][color=#80CC33][item=leafage]__ITEM__leafage__[/color][/font]. And you just pile them up. There are bacteria in the ground which will eat the stuff and turn it into [font=default-bold][color=#80CC33][item=humus]__ITEM__humus__[/color][/font] - that's a smart word for 'soil with a lot of nutrients'. It's kind of a cycle. Soil turns into plant, plant turns back into soil.
composting-text6=First, you build a [font=default-bold][color=#80CC33][item=composting-silo]__ITEM__composting-silo__[/color][/font]. Those Clockwork guys engineered that to provide a good environment for your ground bacteria. You throw it aaaalll in there. And on the bottom of your huge plant-pile, the bacteria party starts.
composting-text7=But now the [font=default-bold][color=#80CC33][item=humus]__ITEM__humus__[/color][/font] is there right at the bottom. A bit inconvenient. For that they designed a [font=default-bold][color=#80CC33][item=composting-silo-output]__ITEM__composting-silo-output__[/color][/font]. You need to place it anywhere near your silo and it will get you the humus with some underground machinery or something like that. I don't know how that works, haha. Just glad it does!
composting-text8=We have a catalogue with all the items that can be composted somewhere in the dayda-tab. It's also mentioned in the tooltips.
composting-text10=Yee. Did I forget something? Some sugar-rich plants create mold inside your silo while they get composted. That's okay. Don't panic. You don't have to clean it up. It won't clog up the silo. And I heard even mold can be useful sometimes.

blood-donations-text1=Blood Donations
blood-donations-text2=Sometimes you just need some blood. Maybe to treat some sick huwan, maybe for some biotechnological process, maybe not, I don't judge.
blood-donations-text3=In the beginning you can donate blood by yourself at the cost of some health points. But you are limited by your body's ability to recover. You might only want to donate once - maybe twice, per day (around 7 real world minutes) or else it will hurt much more.
blood-donations-text4=But as a seasoned Factorio player, you surely want to avoid having to do this manually all the time. The key to automation is the [font=default-bold][color=#80CC33][technology=transfusion-medicine]Transfusion Medicine[/color][/font] research. This allows your huwans to donate blood in a nearby hospital or med bay.
blood-donations-text5=Only healthy huwans will donate blood. How often they do this depends on their Health. The blood donation needs [font=default-bold]10 operations[/font] on the side of the hospital.
