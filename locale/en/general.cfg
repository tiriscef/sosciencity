[disease-description]
limp-loss=This poor soul lost a limp.

biter-bite=A biter did... well, what it's named after.
joint-dislocation=Two bones, which normally are connected with a joint, ... aren't connected anymore.
hematoma=A black eye. But most of the time at another body part.

rare-cold=A viral infectious disease caused by a wide variety of rhinoviruses. It can be recognized by walky, runny or sprinty noses.
weak-heart=Not to be overly specific: the heart is supposed to pump blood constantly. But this one struggles quite a bit with that task.
yeast-infection=Yeast bacteria populating this poor soul's skin.
riverhorse-like-flu=Symptoms that resemble those of the riverhorse flu. Not infectious.
headaches=Longer lasting headaches, making every act a burden.
diarrhea=We don't like to talk about it.
exhaustion=Sometimes people just need a break and do nothing productive to load up their inner battery. They called in sick as an excuse to not be seen as lazy. But really they likely sit at home playing the latest video game.
kidney-stone=Mineral salts that crystallize in the urinary tract. Normally they get flushed out without a problem, but sometimes they stay and can cause a sharp pain if they grow too big.

depression=This poor soul's brain produces way too less serotonin, which results in low moods, lacking energy and loss of interest.
reality-loss=This poor soul thinks that it is not real, but just a statistical number in a video game.
factorio-addiction=Once you boot up the popular videogame factorio, there is no going back.
schizophrenia=This poor soul suffers from continuous psychosis with symptoms like hearing voices, paranoia or a loss of perception.
burnout=This soul is in a state of great mental exhaustion from their work or occupation.

gender-dysphoria=This person doesn't identify with the gender they were assigned at birth, which causes them to feel disconnected from their body. They are requesting sex reassignment treatment to help them in their transition.\n[color=#a7842c](Note: Being trans is neither a disorder, nor wrong in any other form.)[/color]
lack-of-purple-blood-cells=Huwan blood normally has so called Purple Blood Cells, which really are rather green when observed under a microscope. The name is because they were discovered by Prof. Dr. Purple. These cells assist the transport of oxygen.\n\nSometimes huwans are born without any at all. They can survive like this, but are extremely easily exhausted. A simple transfusion of healthy blood primes the blood with PBC.
huntingtons=A genetic, inherited disease which causes a gradual loss of all mental abilities and ends fatal.

lung-infection=The lung is infected with bacteria. They are acting like jerks by killing the lung cells.
necrosis=Dying, bacteria-infested body cells.
