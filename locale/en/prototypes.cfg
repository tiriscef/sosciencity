[tips-and-tricks-item-description]
sosciencity-intro=Welcome to Sosciencity. Here's a quick Tiristroduction. That's... an introduction written by tiriscef.\n\nYeah. Anyway. To progress in Sosciencity you'll need to built a city with happy huwans living in there. The huwan sosciety is split into 8 castes, all with their own lifestyle and needs. While you progress throughout the mod, you will integrate them all into your city one after another.\n\nIn Sosciencity you'll need your huwans to help with your research. You might already have noticed that you need [item=sketchbook] to produce the first science pack. You can brainstorm a bit and come up with your own for now, but to automate them you'll need to unlock the [technology=ember-caste].\n\nI'll be back and tell you how to set up your first settlement after you researched the Clockwork caste.
sosciencity-caste-boni=If your inhabitants are happy and healthy, they will work for you.\n - Inhabitants can work in nearby manufactories or other buildings that need workers.\n - Otherwise they will work to generate a caste-specific bonus for your city.\n\nThe work of unemployed inhabitants produces caste bonus points, depending on their happiness. The more points, the greater the caste bonus. You can get more information about the bonus via the caste displays on the top left corner of your screen.
sosciencity-maintenance=In Sosciencity you need mechanics that maintain your machines. That's the job of the Clockwork caste. Every machine of your factory needs 1 Clockwork point to run smootly. If your city provides less points than what is needed for maintenace, your machines will begin to slow down by up to -60%.\nOn the other hand: Surplus points will even increase the speed of your machines. That's the normal Clockwork bonus.\n\nIn the beginning of the game this can be tough. So don't build big until you have a healthy settlement going.\n\n[color=#AAAAAA]There are free 'startup' points, configurable in the Map settings.\n(Also you can disable this mechanic entirely in the settings, in case you don't like it.)[/color]
sosciencity-first-settlement=So you finally researched the Clockwork Caste. You can now create your first settlement.\n\nBut before you do that, you need to prepare some infrastructure to meet the basic needs of your people.\n\n - [font=default-bold]Housing:[/font] Everyone needs some kind of home with a roof on top. Homeless inhabitants won't be able to live comfortably and work for you. So built some houses first. For now you are limited to [entity=living-container]. Those are nothing much, but will work for now. After placing it, click on it and assign it to the Clockwork Caste to allow them to move inside.\n - [font=default-bold]Food:[/font] Collect some food via [recipe=gathering-food], so your inhabitants have something to eat. You can provide it to them by either placing it in their homes or in a [entity=market-hall].\n - [font=default-bold]Water:[/font] Provide water to your people's homes with a [entity=water-tower] in range of your houses. The normal water you use to power your steam-engines isn't exactly save to consume. So better drill for some [fluid=clean-water] with a [entity=groundwater-pump].\n - [font=default-bold]Garbage:[/font] Soon your inhabitants will produce some garbage. If you don't provide them a way to get rid of it, it will accumulate in their homes and make everyone sick. So build a [entity=trash-site], so they have a place to dispose it.\n\nTip: Place your first settlement next to a forest or a body of water, so you can automate the food supply with a [entity=hunting-hut] or a [entity=fishing-hut].
sosciencity-reproduction=Once you have your infrastructure in place, build an [entity=upbringing-station]. This building will hatch and raise huwan eggs you put inside. You can get your first eggs at the cost of some food calories via [recipe=lay-egg].\n\n[color=#CCCCCC]The reproductive biology of huwans is more complex than that of humans. You, the engineer, are some kind of queen gender that can reproduce asexually. But your children will be agender,... so infertile. Later on you might find a way to get gendered huwans that can reproduce and lay eggs without your involvement. (Don't quote me too hard on that, I'm not a biologist.)[/color]
sosciencity-housing=Houses have 3 attributes: number of living rooms, comfort and an array of qualities.\n\n - [font=default-bold]Living Rooms:[/font] Determine how many people can live in there. How many rooms each inhabitant occupies depends on the caste. The Clockwork Caste for example is pretty simple: one room per inhabitant.\n - [font=default-bold]Comfort:[/font] How furnitured the house is, described by a number. This influences the happiness and sanity of the inhabitants. Some castes have a minimum comfort and won't move into a house that doesn't meet that.\n - [font=default-bold]Qualities:[/font] Describes how the house looks and feels inside. Every caste has their own idea which qualities they like or despise. For example: people from the Clockwork Caste like houses with the 'technical' quality, but are less happy with a 'decorated' home.
sosciencity-food-supply=Your inhabitants need something to eat. You can provide them food either by placing it inside their home or in a nearby [entity=market-hall]. What you give your inhabitants to eat has several effects:\n\n[font=default-bold]Happiness:[/font] How happy the food makes your people depends on the Taste quality and Luxury of the foods provided. How important both categories are depends on the Caste. These values are judged higher if the Taste category matches those the Caste generally likes. Or lower if they hate it.\n[font=default-bold]Variety: [/font] Providing many different kinds of food makes people even happier.\n[font=default-bold]Healthiness:[/font] You are what you eat, so the Healthiness values of the provided foods affect the Health of your people.\n[font=default-bold]Nutrients:[/font] The macronutrients of the foods also affect Health. An optimal diet consists of 20% protein, 50% carbohydrates and 30% fat. The closer the food mix comes to that, the better.\n[font=default-bold]Sanity:[/font] Usually there is no effect on Sanity. But if you provide e.g. just bland, neutral-tasting food - that can take a toll on your people's psyche.\n\nI'm sorry if that is a lot and hard to grasp. What you eat is a highly complex and a bit of a personal matter.
sosciencity-water-supply=Your inhabitants need drinkable water. You can provide that with a [entity=water-tower] placed in range of their house.\n\nThe normal water you get with a offshore pump isn't really ready to drink. You'll need to either clean it or get clean groundwater with a [entity=groundwater-pump].
sosciencity-garbage-collection=Your inhabitants produce [item=garbage] and [item=food-leftovers] over time. Without garbage collection, all that will end up in their homes or the nearby environment, which makes everyone unhappy und unhealthy.\n\nProviding a [entity=trash-site] nearby will make your inhabitants dispose garbage there. Then you can get rid of it, for example by burning it in a furnace.
sosciencity-healthcare=People get sick from time to time. Diseases are very versatile and come from different sources:\n\n - [font=default-bold]Health:[/font] People attract physical diseases from time to time. That's life. A high Health value decreases the frequency with which your inhabitants get sick.\n - [font=default-bold]Sanity:[/font] Sometimes people develop mental health problems. Life is not easy. A high Sanity value decreases the frequency of those.\n - [font=default-bold]Work:[/font] Working in a manufactory takes a toll on your inhabitants. Exhaustion and workplace accidents sometimes knocks them out.\n - [font=default-bold]Birth:[/font] Some inhabitants come to this world with disabilities or other problems. These are rare, but usually pretty hard to cure.\n\nSome of these diseases go away naturally after some time. But others don't. Some can escalate into more severe diseases if not cured or even end with death. Some are even infectious and can spread in your city if left unchecked.\nSo it is advisable to provide healthcare to your inhabitants to keep everyone save and healthy.\n\nYou can provide healthcare to your people by building medbays or hospitals. Curing a disease takes some work by the healthcare workers (displayed as 'operations').\nSome cures need medicine items (provided in the hospital or in a pharmacy) or specialised facilities.
